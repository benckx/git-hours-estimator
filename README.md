# About 

Estimate the amount of work spent on a project based on the git commits timestamp.

Algo is based on this (but I couldn't make it work):
https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours

# How To

Navigate to a git project and pipe the result to estimator.py:
```bash
git log --date=iso --pretty=format:'%at' | python3 estimator.py
```
or
```bash
git log --date=iso --pretty=format:'%at' | python3 ../git-hours-estimator/estimator.py
```

Output should be something like:
```
âžœ  my-super-project git:(master) git log --date=iso --pretty=format:'%at' | python3 ../git-hours-estimator/estimator.py
